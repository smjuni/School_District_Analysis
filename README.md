## Module 4 - Pandas and Jupyter Notebook


## Overview of the School District Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to provide an overview of the school district's key metrics which include: math and reading scores and percentages based on these scores. After receiving evidence of academic dishonesty, we then reran the analysis omitting Thomas High School Ninth graders and compared the results.
The analysis includes:
- The district summary
- The School summary
- The top 5 and bottom 5 schools
- The average math scores of the students at each grade level per school
- The average reading score of the students at each grade level per school
- school performance based on 
    - budget spend per student
    - school size
    - school type


## Results


### - How is the district summary affected?
We removed the ninth grade math and reading scores for Thomas High School, however we did not remove the students from the district student count. After updating the calculations the outcome was that the Average Math Score dropped by 0.1%.
